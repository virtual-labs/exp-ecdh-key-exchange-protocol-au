## Elliptic Curve Cryptography Simulation Procedure

## Objective
The objective of this experiment is to simulate the elliptic curve cryptography process, focusing on curve selection, private and public key generation, and secret key calculation for two users, A and B.

## Experimental Steps

### Step 1: Elliptic Curve Selection

1. Pre-select an elliptic curve with parameters a, b, and q.
   - For example, consider Curve25519 with q as a prime or an integer of the form 2^m.
2. Students select a point G on the curve with a large order n.

### Step 2: User A Key Generation

3. Student selects a private key nA (where nA < n).
4. Calculates the public key PA using the formula: PA = nA * G.

### Step 3: User B Key Generation

5. Student selects a private key nB (where nB < n).
6. Calculates the public key PB using the formula: PB = nB * G.

### Step 4: Secret Key Calculation for User A

7. Secret key of user A is calculated as K_A = nA * PB.

### Step 5: Secret Key Calculation for User B

8. Secret key of user B is calculated as K_B = nB * PA.

## Conclusion
This experiment aims to provide participants with hands-on experience in elliptic curve cryptography, emphasizing key generation and secret key calculation for secure communication between users A and B. Understanding the mathematical principles behind elliptic curves is crucial for cryptographic applications, and this simulation enhances comprehension through practical engagement.
