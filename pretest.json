    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman (ECDH) Key Exchange Protocol?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To encrypt data during transmission.",
        "b": "To establish a shared secret key between two parties over an insecure communication channel.",
        "c": "To authenticate users in a network.",
        "d": "To compress data before transmission."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The primary purpose of ECDH is to establish a shared secret key, not to directly encrypt data during transmission.",
        "b": "Correct. The ECDH Key Exchange Protocol is designed to establish a shared secret key securely between two parties over an insecure communication channel.",
        "c": "Incorrect. ECDH is focused on key exchange rather than user authentication.",
        "d": "Incorrect. ECDH is not designed for data compression."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "How is User A's public key calculated in the ECDH Key Exchange Protocol?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By adding User A's private key to a fixed constant.",
        "b": "By multiplying User A's private key with a generator point on the elliptic curve (G).",
        "c": "By subtracting User A's private key from a random number.",
        "d": "By dividing User A's private key by a prime number (n)."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. User A's public key is calculated through multiplication, not addition.",
        "b": "Correct. User A's public key is computed by multiplying their private key with a generator point on the elliptic curve, denoted as G.",
        "c": "Incorrect. User A's public key is calculated through multiplication, not subtraction.",
        "d": "Incorrect. User A's public key is calculated through multiplication, not division."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is it important for the private keys (nA and nB) to be chosen such that (nA < n) and (nB < n) in ECDH Key Exchange?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To speed up the key exchange process.",
        "b": "To ensure that the public keys are small and easy to compute.",
        "c": "To prevent potential vulnerabilities and ensure security.",
        "d": "To reduce the computational load on the elliptic curve generator."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The size of private keys does not directly impact the speed of the key exchange process.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The size of public keys is influenced by the choice of elliptic curve parameters, not the private key values.",
        "c": "Correct. Choosing private keys within specific ranges helps prevent vulnerabilities and ensures the security of the key exchange process.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The private key range does not significantly affect the computational load on the elliptic curve generator."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
