      "question": "How is the secret key (K) calculated for User B in the ECDH Key Exchange Protocol?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By adding User B's private key to User A's public key.",
        "b": "By multiplying User B's private key with a generator point on the elliptic curve (G).",
        "c": "By subtracting User B's private key from a random number.",
        "d": "By dividing User B's private key by a prime number (n)."
        },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The secret key for User B is not calculated by adding their private key to User A's public key.",
        "b": "Correct. The secret key for User B is derived by multiplying their private key with User A's public key in the ECDH Key Exchange Protocol.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Subtracting User B's private key from a random number is not the correct method for calculating the secret key.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Dividing User B's private key by a prime number (n) is not the correct method for calculating the secret key."

      "question": "What does the shared secret key (K) represent in the ECDH Key Exchange Protocol?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "User A's private key.",
        "b": "User B's private key.",
        "c": "A randomly generated value.",
        "d": "A common secret known to both User A and User B."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The shared secret key (K) does not represent User A's private key.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The shared secret key (K) does not represent User B's private key.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The shared secret key (K) is not a randomly generated value.",
        "d": "Correct. The shared secret key (K) is a common secret known only to User A and User B, ensuring secure communication."

      "question": "What role does the generator point (G) play in the ECDH Key Exchange Protocol?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It determines the size of the public keys.",
        "b": "It is used to generate a random number for key derivation.",
        "c": "It serves as the base point for elliptic curve operations.",
        "d": "It specifies the prime number (n) used in key calculations."
